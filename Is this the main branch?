I was arranging wood in my fireplace when suddenly the door burst open.

Once, while waiting for the bus, a man sat down next to me and proceeded to tell me the strangest story.

While gazing out the window of my third-floor apartment, something startling caught my eye.

My bestfriend growing up who was very secretive. 

I was reading a book from the library when something slipped out of it. 

A picture fell out of it. 

It was very old and damaged. 

I pick it from the floor and this is my suprise was at its upmost.
